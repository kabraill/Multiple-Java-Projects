# Multiple-Java-Projects

This repository contains multiple Java projects, each organized under its respective package structure.

- **algorithms/**:
  
  **CustomDrawing:** This is a Java application that allows users to draw lines and ovals using mouse movement, based on their selection. Instead of relying on Java Swing’s built-in drawing functions, it utilizes mathematical algorithms—specifically Bresenham's line algorithm and the Midpoint ellipse algorithm—to render shapes pixel by pixel.

  **DijkstraAlgorithm:** A console-based Java application that implements Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph. The user can define the graph structure and source node, and the program outputs the minimum distances from the source to all other nodes.
	
  **FordFulkerson:** A console-based Java application that implements the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to calculate the maximum flow in a flow network. Users can define the network through adjacency matrices or edge lists, and the program computes the maximum possible flow from a given source node to a sink node using the Edmonds-Karp (BFS-based) approach.
	
  **ImageFilterApp:** ImageFilterApp: A graphical user interface (GUI) application that enables users to open images and apply various image processing filters. Supported filters include grayscale, blur, sharpening, and thresholding, all implemented using custom algorithms.
		
  **Permutations_Combinations:** This application implements four algorithms to generate and display all possible permutations and combinations of a given set, rather than merely calculating the total count of possible outcomes.
