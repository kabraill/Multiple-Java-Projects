  CustomDrawing: This is a Java application that allows users to draw lines and ovals using mouse movement, based on their selection. Instead of relying on Java Swing’s built-in drawing functions, it utilizes mathematical algorithms—specifically Bresenham's line algorithm and the Midpoint ellipse algorithm—to render shapes pixel by pixel.
